      Technology is everywhere, and it is ever changing. From hardware to software, it has entered our personal and professional lives on a very deep level. It is fair to say that we strongly depend on it now.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is even more true for businesses in technology. Actually, in some cases technology is the sole fabric of a company. No Internet, no business. It is that simple.
    </p>

    <p>
      That strong dependency must be proportional to the care we invest into it as entrepreneurs. The care to inform our decisions when chosing such language or framework. The care to hire the right people with the right skills, the right mindset, and to grow them. The care to invest in properly managing our teams and maintaining our technological edge. The care to pay technological debt in time, before we lose productivity and flexibility. We need to care, deeply, daily , truthfully, to maintain our technological leverage.
