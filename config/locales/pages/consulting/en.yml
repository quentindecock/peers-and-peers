      As entrepreneurs the decisions we need to make about technology are far from obvious:
      <ul>
        <li> How should we organize the dev team ?  </li>
        <li> Which language and framework should we pick ? </li>
        <li> How should we handle massive amounts of data ? </li>
        <li> Will our systems hold the growing traffic ? </li>
        <li> Should we start implementing automated test now or later ? </li>
        <li> Should we pay technical debt now or later ? </li>
        <li> Should we migrate everything to the cloud or host on barebone cheap servers ? </li>
        <li> Is our data and systems secure ? </li>
        <li> How can we keep uptime high ? </li>
