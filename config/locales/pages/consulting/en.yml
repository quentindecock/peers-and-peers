      As entrepreneurs the decisions we need to make about technology are far from obvious:
      <ul>
        <li> How should I organize the dev team?  </li>
        <li> Which language and framework should we pick? </li>
        <li> How should I handle my data? </li>
        <li> Should I start implementing automated test now or later? </li>
        <li> Should I pay technical debt now or later? </li>
        <li> Should I migrate everything to the cloud or host my own services? </li>
        <li> etc. </li>
